        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims, such as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character traits. These aims may include the development of understanding, rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the role of critical thinking in order to distinguish education from indoctrination. Some theorists require that education results in an improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral definition of the term. In a slightly different sense, education may also refer, not to the process, but to the product of this process: the mental states and dispositions possessed by educated people. Education originated as the transmission of cultural heritage from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals increasingly encompass new ideas such as the liberation of learners, skills needed for modern society, empathy, and complex vocational skills.

            Types of education are commonly divided into formal, non-formal, and informal education. Formal education takes place in education and training institutions, is usually structured by curricular aims and objectives, and learning is typically guided by a teacher. In most regions, formal education is compulsory up to a certain age and commonly divided into educational stages such as kindergarten, primary school and secondary school. Nonformal education occurs as addition or alternative to formal education.[1] It may be structured according to educational arrangements, but in a more flexible manner, and usually takes place in community-based, workplace-based or civil society-based settings.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Educational transformation refers to systemic changes in the prevailing educational model. Distinguishing itself from the theories that defend reforms or renovations of some elements of the model, maintaining the substance of the traditional teaching and learning process, and its organization and structure.</p>

        <p class="sectionTag text-big">Let's Grow Together</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Let's Build a World Together contains more songs celebrating the fairy tale romance of country music's royal couple featuring producer Billy Sherrill's Phil Spector-influenced production. Regardless of what the reality may have been, country fans couldn't get enough of the pair who appeared to be living every word they sang. As Eugene Chadbourne of AllMusic astutely observes, "The chemistry that develops between partners in a male and female country music duo can sometimes be based on fantasy, as was obviously the case with Loretta Lynn and Ernest Tubb, who no country listener even imagined for a moment were romantically involved. Tammy Wynette and George Jones, on the other hand, did have a relationship." The truth was not as idyllic as their fans preferred to imagine it. Years later, in the documentary Stand By Your Dream, Wynette recalled, "It was very difficult on us, both of us being in the business and both of us being together twenty-four hours a day. We were constantly together. We never had any breathing room, no space...And Jones had a very bad drinking problem, and I knew that when we married but, you know, you always think, 'Oh shoot, he'll be so happy when he marries me and that'll all stop.' You think you can change somebody but you never can.</p>
